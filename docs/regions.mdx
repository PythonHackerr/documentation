Regions provides the following user context:

```json
{
  "country": {
    "code": "US",
    "name": "United States",
    "flag": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸"
  },
  "state": {
    "code": "MD",
    "name": "Maryland"
  },
  "dma": {
    "code": "26",
    "name": "Baltimore"
  },
  "postalCode": {
    "code": "21014"
  }
}
```

Regions also provides the following events:

- `user.entered_region_country`
- `user.exited_region_country`
- `user.entered_region_state`
- `user.exited_region_state`
- `user.entered_region_dma`
- `user.exited_region_dma`
- `user.entered_region_postal_code`
- `user.exited_region_postal_code`

## Quickstart

First, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for Radar and get an API key.

Then, enable Regions events on the [Settings page](https://radar.com/dashboard/settings).

From there, [integrate the SDK](/documentation/sdk) and call `Radar.trackOnce()` or `Radar.startTracking()`, depending on your use case. Radar will generate an entry event on the first location update in a region matching your enabled event types.

## Countries

Regions supports country detection globally. Each country has a `name` and a unique 2-letter [ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes) `code`. View the [full list of countries](/regions/countries).

### Country allowlist or blocklist

Regions can also be used to allowlist or blocklist location updates in specific countries for privacy or compliance reasons. Contact your customer success manager to enable this feature.

## States

Regions supports state detection in the US and Canada only. Each state has a `name` and a 2-letter `code` unique to the residing `country`. View the [full list of states](/regions/states).

## DMAs

Regions supports DMA (designated market area) detection in the US only. Each DMA has a `name` and a unique `code`. View the [full list of DMAs](/regions/dmas). Or, learn more about [DMAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market).

## Postal codes

Regions supports postal (ZIP) code detection in the US only. Each postal code has a unique 5-letter `code`.

## Coarse Insights

With Coarse Insights, you can leverage home region and traveling detection on global regions. This includes a `city` field for non-US countries.

Coarse Insights provides the following user context:

```json
{
  "recentHomeRegions": [],
  "homeRegions": {
    "countryRegion": "5cf694f66da6a800683f4d71",
    "stateRegion": "5cf695086da6a800683f4e69",
    "dma": "5cf694fb6da6a800683f4d92",
    "postalCode": "5cf6955c6da6a800683f6753",
    "country": {
      "_id":  "5cf694f66da6a800683f4d71",
      "type": "country",
      "name": "United States",
      "code": "US",
      "icon": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸",
    },
    "state": {
      "_id":  "5cf695086da6a800683f4e69",
      "type": "state",
      "name": "Maryland",
      "code": "MD",
      "icon": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸",
    },
    "dma": {
      "_id":  "5cf694fb6da6a800683f4d92",
      "type": "dma",
      "name": "Baltimore",
      "code": "26",
      "icon": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸",
    }
    "postalCode": {
      "_id":  "5cf6955c6da6a800683f6753",
      "type": "postalCode",
      "name": "21014",
      "code": "21014",
      "icon": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸",
    }
  }
}
```

As well as the following event context:
```json
{
  "traveling": {
    "country": true,
    "dma": true,
    "state": true,
    "postalCode": true,
    "city": true,
  }
}
```

## Quickstart

First, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for Radar and get an API key.

Contact your customer success manager to enable Coarse Insights.

From there, [integrate the SDK](/documentation/sdk) and call `Radar.trackOnce()` or `Radar.startTracking()`, depending on your use case. Radar will set the home regions based on the location tracked, as well as update the recent home regions list with a new entry.

## How it works

The first time a user is tracked either in the day or upon creation, the determined regions are added to the list of recent home regions. This list comprises the past 30 days in which at least one track call was made for the respective user. The most frequently occurring entry is then set as the user's home regions.
If the most recent entry is different from the user's home regions, the user is determined to be traveling and the event context is updated accordingly.

Home Regions can be enabled even if [Regions](/documentation/regions) event types are not.
