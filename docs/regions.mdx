Regions provides the following user context:

```json
{
  "country": {
    "code": "US",
    "name": "United States",
    "flag": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸"
  },
  "state": {
    "code": "MD",
    "name": "Maryland"
  },
  "dma": {
    "code": "26",
    "name": "Baltimore"
  },
  "postalCode": {
    "code": "21014"
  }
}
```

Regions also provides the following events:

- `user.entered_region_country`
- `user.exited_region_country`
- `user.entered_region_state`
- `user.exited_region_state`
- `user.entered_region_dma`
- `user.exited_region_dma`
- `user.entered_region_postal_code`
- `user.exited_region_postal_code`

## Quickstart

First, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for Radar and get an API key.

Then, enable Regions events on the [Settings page](https://radar.com/dashboard/settings).

From there, [integrate the SDK](/documentation/sdk) and call `Radar.trackOnce()` or `Radar.startTracking()`, depending on your use case. Radar will generate an entry event on the first location update in a region matching your enabled event types.

## Countries

Regions supports country detection globally. Each country has a `name` and a unique 2-letter [ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes) `code`. View the [full list of countries](/regions/countries).

### Country allowlist or blocklist

Regions can also be used to allowlist or blocklist location updates in specific countries for privacy or compliance reasons. Contact your customer success manager to enable this feature.

## States

Regions supports state detection in the US and Canada only. Each state has a `name` and a 2-letter `code` unique to the residing `country`. View the [full list of states](/regions/states).

## DMAs

Regions supports DMA (designated market area) detection in the US only. Each DMA has a `name` and a unique `code`. View the [full list of DMAs](/regions/dmas). Or, learn more about [DMAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market).

## Postal codes

Regions supports postal (ZIP) code detection in the US only. Each postal code has a unique 5-letter `code`.

## Coarse insights

With Coarse Insights, you can determine a user's home regions and detect traveling across our global coverage. To enable, contact your customer success manager.

Coarse Insights provides the following user context:

```json
{
  "recentHomeRegions": [],
  "homeRegions": {
    "country": {
      "_id":  "5cf694f66da6a800683f4d71",
      "type": "country",
      "name": "United States",
      "code": "US",
      "icon": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸",
    },
    "state": {
      "_id":  "5cf695086da6a800683f4e69",
      "type": "state",
      "name": "Maryland",
      "code": "MD",
      "icon": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸",
    },
    "dma": {
      "_id":  "5cf694fb6da6a800683f4d92",
      "type": "dma",
      "name": "Baltimore",
      "code": "26",
      "icon": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸",
    }
    "postalCode": {
      "_id":  "5cf6955c6da6a800683f6753",
      "type": "postalCode",
      "name": "21014",
      "code": "21014",
      "icon": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸",
    }
  }
}
```

It also provides the following event context:
```json
{
  "traveling": {
    "country": true,
    "dma": true,
    "state": true,
    "postalCode": true,
    "city": true,
  }
}
```

### How it works

Upon the first track call of the day, the regions calculated for a given user are stored in a recency list. A user's home regions are determined by calculating the most frequently occurring regions from this list, storing up to the past 30 days in which a track call was made.
If the most recent entry is different from the user's home regions, the user is determined to be traveling and the event context is updated accordingly.
