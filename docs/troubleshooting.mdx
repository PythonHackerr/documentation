### Why is a device not appearing in the Radar dashboard?

A device will only appear on the [Users page](https://radar.com/dashboard/users) in the Radar dashboard if a location update has been successfully sent via the [SDK](/sdk), [simulator](/dashboard#simulator), or manually to Radar's [track API](/api#track). If using the SDK, verify location permissions have been granted and a Radar tracking method (`Radar.trackOnce()` or `Radar.startTracking()`) has been called. If a device is still not appearing in the Radar dashboard, set up the error listener in the SDK to monitor for errors and set the SDK log level to `debug`.

### Why do I have multiple users with the same user ID or device ID?

The Radar [iOS](/sdk/ios) and [Android](/sdk/android) SDKs automatically generate a unique `installId` on every fresh install. Radar creates a new user record for every unique `installId`. Multiple user records may have the same `userId` value or `deviceId` value if they have different `installId` values. Multiple users generating without uninstalls indicates a potential issue setting the `userId` in the SDK (i.e. passing in `null` for the `userId` in certain scenarios).

### Why am I not seeing geofence events trigger in Radar?

On the Users detail page, verify the time that the last location update was sent to Radar via the Location section. View recent location updates and events on the [User Activity](/dashboard#user-activity) page. If location updates are not delivering at the expected interval, verify your [tracking options](/sdk/tracking) are correct and applied properly. If events are not triggering, verify geofence [entry and exit settings](/geofences#stop-detection). **Note that a device needs to exit a geofence before generating a subsequent entry event, so ensure that the device has been detected outside of the geofence prior to testing another entry.**

### Why am I seeing rate limit errors when tracking location?

Radar has device specific rate limits per second, hour and day for the [track API endpoint](/api#track), which sends location updates to Radar. To mitigate rate limits, adjust [tracking options](/sdk/tracking) to collect locations less frequently. If you hit the per hour or day limits while testing, reinstsalling the application with the Radar SDK will reset the rate limits.
