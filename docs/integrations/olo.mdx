Radar can [create and cancel trips](/trip-tracking) for customer arrival tracking when orders are placed or cancelled in [Olo](https://www.olo.com). Additionally, with *Order firing enabled*, location can power when an order should be manually fired to Olo (e.g. 5 minutes away).

## Configuration

Configure a Olo webhook to deliver to https://api.radar.io/webhooks/olo for the relevant Order Events via the Development Tools section of the Olo Dashboard (requires 2 factor authentication and at least Brand Manager permission). When order events are triggered in Olo, Olo will call the Radar webhook. Collect your brand ID from Olo.

Then, on the Radar [Integrations page](https://radar.com/dashboard/integrations) under *Olo*, set *Enabled* to *Yes* and paste your brand ID. Enter a destination geofence tag (e.g., `restaurant`), and optionally map fields from the Olo webhook body to Radar trip metadata. Select the applicable Olo *Handoff modes* that should trigger trip create and cancel events.

Finally, on the Radar [Geofences page](https://radar.com/dashboard/geofences), [import geofences](/geofences) for your restaurants. For destination geofence tag in the Olo configuration, use the tag used in the restaurant geofence configuration.

Based on your settings, Radar will automatically create trips when orders are placed and cancel trips cancelled in Olo. You will need to call `Radar.startTrip()` with just the olo order id as the trip options external Id and `Radar.startTracking()` and `Radar.stopTracking()` to start and stop location tracking in your app when a trip is in progress.

Assuming the customer has granted location permissions and location tracking has been started in your app, Radar will generate location-based `user.updated_trip`, `user.approaching_trip_destination`, and `user.arrived_at_trip_destination` events and calculate live ETAs to the restaurant for each order. Learn more about [Trip Tracking](/trip-tracking).

## Order Firing

In order for Radar to automatically fire your orders based on location proximity, you will need to submit your baskets to Olo as `ismanualfire` and will also need to set a `scheduledArrivalAt` datetime to the Radar trip as a fallback in the event location is disabled or the device is experiencing connectivity issues. This can be done using `Radar.updateTrip()` in the app or [Trips API](https://radar.com/documentation/api#trips) server-side.

In addition to the above Olo and Radar configuration, you will need to generate API credentials for the Radar platform in the [Olo development portal](https://developer.olo.com/). On the Radar [Integrations page](https://radar.com/dashboard/integrations) under *Olo*, you will will need to set *Order firing enabled* to *Yes*, paste the Olo Radar `Client Id` and `Secret Key`, and `Save` your integration settings.

Finally, in the Radar [Trips Settings](https://radar.com/dashboard/settings#trips-settings), set the *Approaching threshold (minutes)* value to the # of minutes away from arriving that the order should automatically be fired to Olo. Now when an active trip generates a `user.approaching_trip_destination` event, Radar will fire the order. In the event the `scheduledArrivalAt` set on the trip occurs first, this datetime will fire the order instead.
