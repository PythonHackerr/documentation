Use our industry-leading [SDK](/sdk) to build experiences for curbside and in-store pickup, delivery tracking, and more.

## Quickstart

Want to get started quickly? Follow these three steps:

1. **Create geofences.** Import [geofences](/geofences) for your locations. Depending on your use case, a geofence might represent a retail store, a restaurant, a hotel, and so on.

2. **Integrate the Radar SDK into your app.** Integrate the [SDK](/sdk) into your app or website. When a customer places an order or taps "I'm on my way," start tracking and start a trip with custom metadata (like order ID, license plate, or car model).

3. **Display live trips and ETAs.** Display live ETAs on the trip tracking dashboard, available on the [Enterprise](https://radar.io/pricing) plan. Or, display live ETAs in your own UI by polling the [list trips API](/api#list-trips) or listening for [trip events](/trip-tracking#trip-events) sent to a webhook.

## Starting and stopping trips

Integrate the [SDK](/sdk) into your app or website. When a customer places an order or taps "I'm on my way," start tracking and start a trip with an ID, a destination geofence, a travel mode, and custom metadata (e.g., customer name, car model, or license plate) depending on your use case.

When the order is picked up or a customer taps "I'm here," stop tracking and stop the trip.

For example, on iOS:

```swift
// order placed or user taps "I'm on my way"
let tripOptions = RadarTripOptions(externalId: "299")
tripOptions.destinationGeofenceTag = "store"
tripOptions.destinationGeofenceExternalId = "123"
tripOptions.mode = .car
tripOptions.metadata = [
  "Customer Name": "Jacob Pena",
  "Car Model": "Green Honda Civic"
]
Radar.startTrip(options: tripOptions)
Radar.startTracking(trackingOptions: .continuous)

// order picked up or user taps "I'm here"
Radar.completeTrip()
Radar.stopTracking()
```

## Trip events

Radar calculates ETAs and generates events when trips are updated:

- `user.started_trip`
- `user.updated_trip`
- `user.approaching_trip_destination` (configurable ETA threshold)
- `user.arrived_at_trip_destination` (destination geofence entered)
- `user.stopped_trip`

ETAs are calculated based on travel mode using the same routing engine that powers our [distance API](/api#distance).

You can receive events client-side via the [SDK](/sdk) or server-side via [event integrations](/integrations), including webhooks.

## Display live trips and ETAs

### In the Radar trip tracking dashboard

The Radar trip tracking dashboard displays active trips for a specific destination geofence, including ID, custom metadata, and ETA.

The trip tracking dashboard is available on the [Enterprise](https://radar.io/pricing) plan.

Ask your customer success manager for a distribution of the app specific to your organization.

  className="hero-image"
/>

### In your own UI

Poll the [list trips API](/api#list-trips) to retrieve active trips for a specific destination geofence, including ID, custom metadata, and ETA. For example, you might poll the list trips API from an internal dashboard.

Or, listen for [trip events](/trip-tracking#trip-events) sent to a webhook. From there, forward trip information, including ID, custom metadata, and ETA, to other systems. For example, you might set up a webhook that sends ETA to an order management or kitchen display system.
