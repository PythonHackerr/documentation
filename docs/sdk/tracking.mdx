For background tracking, the SDK supports custom tracking options as well as three presets: **`EFFICIENT`**, **`RESPONSIVE`**, and **`CONTINUOUS`**.

Though we recommend using presets for most use cases, you can modify them.

The SDK has two states: **stopped** and **moving**. `stopDuration` and `stopDistance` determine whether a location update is considered stopped, and the other options determine tracking behavior depending on state.

## iOS

### iOS options

- **`desiredStoppedUpdateInterval`**: Determines the desired location update interval in seconds when stopped. Use `0` to shut down when stopped.
- **`desiredMovingUpdateInterval`**: Determines the desired location update interval in seconds when moving. **Note that location updates may be delayed significantly by Low Power Mode, or if the device has connectivity issues, low battery, or wi-fi disabled.**
- **`desiredSyncInterval`**: Determines the desired sync interval in seconds.
- **`desiredAccuracy`**: Determines the desired accuracy of location updates.  `.high` uses `kCLLocationAccuracyBest`, `.medium` uses `kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters`, `.low` uses `kCLLocationAccuracyKilometer`.
- **`stopDuration`**: With `stopDistance`, determines the duration in seconds after which the device is considered stopped.
- **`stopDistance`**: With `stopDuration`, determines the distance in meters within which the device is considered stopped.
- **`startTrackingAfter`**: Determines when to start tracking. Use `nil` to start tracking when `startTracking` is called.
- **`stopTrackingAfter`**: Determines when to stop tracking. Use `nil` to track until `stopTracking` is called.
- **`replay`**: Determines which failed location updates to replay to the server. `.replayStops` replays failed stops, `.replayNone` replays no location updates.
- **`sync`**: Determines which location updates to sync to the server. `.all` syncs all location updates to the server, `.stopsAndExits` syncs only stops and exits to the server, `.none` syncs no location updates to the server.
- **`showBlueBar`**: Determines whether the [flashing blue status bar](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/2923541-showsbackgroundlocationindicator) is shown when tracking.
- **`useStoppedGeofence`**: Determines whether to use the [iOS region monitoring service (geofencing)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/monitoring_the_user_s_proximity_to_geographic_regions) to create a client-side geofence "bubble" around the device's current location when stopped.
- **`stoppedGeofenceRadius`**: Determines the radius in meters of the client-side geofence "bubble" around the device's current location when stopped. Use smaller values (e.g., `100` meters) for faster exit events or larger values (e.g., `200` meters) to avoid jumpy exits while stopped.
- **`useMovingGeofence`**: Determines whether to use the [iOS region monitoring service (geofencing)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/monitoring_the_user_s_proximity_to_geographic_regions) to create a client-side geofence "bubble" around the device's current location when moving.
- **`movingGeofenceRadius`**: Determines the radius in meters of the client-side geofence "bubble" around the device's current location when moving.
- **`syncGeofences`**: Determines whether to sync nearby geofences from the server to the client to improve responsiveness.
- **`useVisits`**: Determines whether to use the [iOS visit monitoring service](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/getting_the_user_s_location/using_the_visits_location_service).
- **`useSignificantLocationChanges`**: Determines whether to use the [iOS significant location change service](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/getting_the_user_s_location/using_the_significant-change_location_service).

### iOS presets

- **`RadarTrackingOptions.efficient`**: A preset that uses the [iOS visit monitoring service](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/getting_the_user_s_location/using_the_visits_location_service) to update only on stops and exits. Must move a significant distance to start moving again after a stop. Lowest battery usage. Recommended.
- **`RadarTrackingOptions.responsive`**: Updates about every 2.5 minutes when moving, shuts down when stopped, and only syncs stops and exits to the server. Requires the `location` background mode. Must move at least 200 meters to start moving again after a stop. Low battery usage.
- **`RadarTrackingOptions.continuous`**: A preset that updates about every 30 seconds and syncs all locations to the server. High battery usage. Shows the flashing blue status bar when tracking.
