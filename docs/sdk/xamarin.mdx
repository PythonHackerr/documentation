This is the documentation for the Xamarin SDK. Before integrating, read the [native SDK documentation](/sdk) to familiarize yourself with the platform.

## Install

Install the package from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Radar.Xamarin/):

```bash
Install-Package Radar.Xamarin
```

If you have an iOS and an Android project, add the package to each project.

## Integrate

### Initialize

First, import the package:

```cs
using Radar.Xamarin;
namespace MyProject
{
    public class Example
    {
        void Example ()
        {
            new Radar().Initialize(publishableKey);
        }
    }
}
```

### Identify user

To identify the user when logged in, call:

```cs
Radar.Instance.SetUserId(userId);
```

where `userId` is a stable unique ID for the user.

To set an optional dictionary of custom metadata for the user, call:

```cs
Radar.Instance.SetMetadata(metadata);
```

where `metadata` is a map with up to 16 keys and values of type string, boolean, or number.

Finally, to set an optional description for the user, displayed in the dashboard, call:

```cs
Radar.Instance.SetDescription(description);
```

where `description` is a string.

You only need to call these functions once, as these settings will be persisted across app sessions.

Learn about platform-specific implementations of these functions in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).

### Request permissions

Before tracking the user's location, the user must have granted location permissions for the app.

See the [Xamarin Geolocation docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/essentials/geolocation) to learn how to request permissions.

### Foreground tracking

Once you have initialized the SDK and the user has granted permissions, you can track the user's location.

To track the user's location in the foreground, call:

```cs
Radar.Instance.TrackOnce((string status, Location location, Dictionary[] events, Dictionary user) => {
  // do something with status, location, events, user
});
```

Learn about platform-specific implementations of this function in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).

### Background tracking

On iOS and Android, once you have initialized the SDK and the user has granted permissions, you can start tracking the user's location in the background.

For background tracking, the SDK supports custom tracking options as well as three presets:

- **`EFFICIENT`**: A low frequency of location updates and lowest battery usage. On Android, avoids Android vitals bad behavior thresholds.
- **`RESPONSIVE`**: A medium frequency of location updates and low battery usage. Suitable for most consumer use cases.
- **`CONTINUOUS`**: A high frequency of location updates and higher battery usage. Suitable for on-demand use cases (e.g., delivery tracking) and some consumer use cases (e.g., order ahead, "mall mode").

Learn about platform-specific implementations of these presets in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).

To start tracking the user's location in the background, call one of:

```cs
Radar.Instance.StartTrackingEfficient();

Radar.Instance.StartTrackingResponsive();

Radar.Instance.StartTrackingContinuous();
```

You only need to call these methods once, as these settings will be persisted across app sessions.

Though we recommend using presets for most use cases, you can customize the tracking options. See the [tracking options reference](/sdk/tracking).

```cs
Dictionary trackingOptions = new Dictionary() {
    { "desiredStoppedUpdateInterval", 180 }, 
    { "desiredStoppedUpdateInterval", 60 },
    { "desiredSyncInterval", 50 },
    { "desiredAccuracy", "high" },
    { "stopDuration", 140 },
    { "stopDistance", 70 },
    { "sync", "all" },
    { "replay", "none" },
    { "showBlueBar", true }
};

Radar.Instance.StartTrackingCustom(trackingOptions);
```

To stop tracking the user's location in the background (e.g., when the user logs out), call:

```cs
Radar.Instance.StopTracking();
```

Learn about platform-specific implementations of these functions in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).

### Mock tracking

On iOS and Android, you can simulate a sequence of location updates for testing. For example, to simulate a sequence of 10 location updates every 3 seconds by car from an `origin` to a `destination`, we can call:

```cs
Location origin = new Location(40.714708, -74.035807);
Location destination = new Location(40.717410, -74.053334);

Radar.Instance.MockTracking(origin, destination, "car", 10, 3);
```

### Trip tracking

On iOS and Android, to start a trip to a destination, call:

```cs
Dictionary tripOptions = new Dictionary() {
    { "externalId", 299 }, 
    { "destinationGeofenceTag", "store" },
    { "destinationGeofenceExternalId", "123" },
    { "mode", "car" }
};

Radar.Instance.StartTrip(tripOptions);
Radar.Instance.StartTrackingContinuous();
```

Later, to complete the trip and stop tracking, call:

```cs
Radar.Instance.CompleteTrip();
Radar.Instance.StopTracking();
```

Or, to cancel the trip and stop tracking, call:

```cs
Radar.Instance.CancelTrip();
Radar.Instance.StopTracking();
```

Learn more about [trip tracking](/trip-tracking).

### Manual tracking

You can manually update the user's location by calling:

```cs
Location location = new Location(40.714708, -74.035807);
location.Accuracy = 65;

Radar.Instance.TrackOnce(location, (string status, Location location, Dictionary[] events, Dictionary user) => {
  // do something with status, location, events, user
});

```

Learn about platform-specific implementation of this function in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).

### Other APIs

The Xamarin SDK also exposes APIs for anonymous context, geocoding, search, and distance.

#### Get location

Get a single location update without sending it to the server:

```cs
Radar.Instance.GetLocation((string status, Location location) => {
  // do something with status, location
});
```

#### Context

With the [context API](/api#context), get context for a location without sending device or user identifiers to the server:

```cs
Radar.Instance.GetContext((string status, Dictionary context) => {
  // do something with status, context
});
```

#### Geocoding

With the [forward geocoding API](/api#forward-geocode), geocode an address, converting address to coordinates:

```cs
Radar.Instance.Geocode("20 jay st brooklyn ny", (string status, Dictionary[] addresses) => {
  // do something with status, addresses
});
```

With the [reverse geocoding API](/api#reverse-geocode), reverse geocode a location, converting coordinates to address:

```cs
Location location = new Location(40.714708, -74.035807);

Radar.Instance.ReverseGeocode(location, (string status, Dictionary[] addresses) => {
  // do something with status, addresses
});
```

With the [IP geocoding API](/api#ip-geocode), geocode the device's current IP address, converting IP address to city, state, and country:

```cs
Radar.Instance.IpGeocode((string status, Dictionary address, bool proxy) => {
  // do something with status, address, proxy
});
```

#### Search

With the [autocomplete API](/api#autocomplete), autocomplete partial addresses and place names, sorted by relevance:

```cs
Location near = new Location(40.783826, -73.975363);

Radar.Instance.Autocomplete("brooklyn roasting", near, 10, (string status, Dictionary[] addresses) => {
  // do something with status, addresses
});
```

With the [geofence search API](/api#search-geofences), search for geofences near a location, sorted by distance:

```cs
Location near = new Location(40.783826, -73.975363);

Radar.Instance.SearchGeofences(near, 1000, new string[]{ "venue" }, 10, (string status, Dictionary[] geofences) => {
  // do something with status, geofences
});
```

With the [places search API](/api#search-places), search for places near a location, sorted by distance:

```cs
Location near = new Location(40.783826, -73.975363);

Radar.Instance.SearchPlaces(near, 1000, new string[]{ "starbucks" }, null, null, 10, (string status, Dictionary[] places) => {
  // do something with status, places
});
```

#### Distance

With the [distance API](/api#distance), calculate the travel distance and duration from an origin to a destination:

```cs
Location origin = new Location(40.78382, -73.97536);
Location destination = new Location(40.70390, -73.98670);

Radar.Instance.GetDistance(origin, destination, new string[]{ "foot", "car" }, "imperial", (string status, Dictionary routes) => {
  // do something with status, places
});
```
